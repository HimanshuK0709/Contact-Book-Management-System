# Contact Book Management System (Python)

This is a beginner-level Python project built to practice core programming concepts such as
data structures, file handling, and persistent storage.

The application allows users to manage contacts using a simple, menu-driven interface in
the terminal.

---

## Features

- Add new contacts with name, phone number, and email ID
- View all saved contacts in a formatted table
- Search for a contact by name
- Edit existing contact details
- Delete contacts
- Store data persistently using a JSON file

---

## Concepts Used

- Python dictionaries and nested dictionaries
- File handling (read/write)
- JSON serialization and deserialization
- Menu-driven program design
- Input normalization and basic validation
- Understanding mutable objects and references

---

## Data Storage

Contact data is stored locally in a JSON file (`contact_book.json`).
The file is loaded when the program starts and updated whenever changes are made,
ensuring data persistence across program runs.

---

## How to Run

1. Clone or download the repository
2. Make sure Python is installed on your system
3. Run the Python file from the terminal:
4. Follow the on-screen menu options

---

## Project Status

This project was created as part of my Python learning journey.
It focuses on understanding logic, data persistence, and clean program flow rather than
advanced features or frameworks.

---

## Future Improvements

- Better input validation
- Confirmation prompts for critical actions
- Improved user interface
- Additional fields for contacts
